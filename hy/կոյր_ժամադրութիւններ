ԿՈՅՐ ԺԱՄԱԴՐՈՒԹԻՒՆՆԵՐ

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,593
Ինքն է։

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,271
Բայց նա մենակ է։

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,392
Ինքն է, ինքն է։

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,432
Լալի՞։ — Հա։

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,995
Ես Իւան եմ։

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,355
Հաճելի է։ — Իսկ նա Սանդրոն է։

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,873
Շատ ուրախ եմ։

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,832
Կներէք որ ուշացանք։

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,672
Մենք վերեւում էինք սպասում։ — Ոչինչ։

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,193
Ես նոր եկայ։

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,358
Ո՞ւր է Մական։

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,035
Մական չեկաւ։ — Ինչո՞ւ չեկաւ։

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,155
Չգիտեմ,

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,639
նա աւտոկայան չէր եկել։

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,875
Ես զանգեցի,

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,075
բայց նա չպատասխանեց։

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,514
Յետոյ հեռախօսս նստեց։

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,398
Չգիտէի ինչ անել,

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,913
ու որոշեցի գալ մենակ։

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,675
Կարո՞ղ է նա յաջորդ

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,313
աւտոբուսն է նստել։

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,155
Կարող ենք նրան սպասել։ Չգիտեմ։

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,638
Զանգիր իմ հեռախօսից։

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,233
Գուցէ պատասխանի։

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,836
Վստա՞հ ես որ նա է։

33
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,878
Նկարում որ ուղարկել էր,

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,393
ուրիշ սանրուածք ունէր։

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,189
Սրտովս չեն էս ինտերնետ ծանօթութիւնները։

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,595
ուրիշ տարբերա՞կներ ունես։

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,512
ունե՞ս թէ չէ։

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,909
Նա լաւ չէր զգում

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,433
եւ չկարողացաւ գալ։

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,078
Կարող ենք ուրիշ անգամ հանդիպել։

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,150
Ինչպէս ուզէք։

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,231
Չէ՞։ Ինչի՞ հետաձգենք

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,799

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,638
Գնա՛նք։

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,512
Ես պէտք է լքեմ ձեզ։

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,835
Չե՞ս գալիս մեզ հետ։

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,070
Չէ, ինձ զանգեցին, գործեր ունեմ։

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,789
Պէտք է գնամ։

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,188
Բայց ես թողնում եմ քեզ

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,793
վստահելի ձեռքերում։

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,431
Կը գա՞ս երկու բառ փոխանակենք։

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,077
Բարեւ ձեզ։ Թամիլան դո՞ւք էք։ — Այո։

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,033
Ես Իւայի ընկերն եմ։

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,713
Նա երկու սենեակ է ամրագրել։

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,790
Բա Իւա՞ն ուր է։

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,315
Դուք պէտք է երկու ժամ առաջ գայիք։

57
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,431
Այո, ուշացել ենք։

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,152
Երկու համար այլեւս պէտք չէ։

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,469
Իւան չի կարող գալ։

60
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,029
Ինչի՞։

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,837
Չգիտեմ, չի կարող։

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,309
Բա երկրորդի համար ո՞վ է վճարելու։

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,793
Երեւի Իւան։ Նա կը զանգի։

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,234
Գիտէ՞ք որտեղ է համարը։ — Չէ։

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,395
Երրորդ հարկ, միջանցքի վերջում։

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,353
Մերսի։

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,039
Գնա՞նք։

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,551
Ուզո՞ւմ ես խմել։ — Չէ մերսի։

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,430
Գուցէ Մի՞րգ։ — Չէ մերսի։

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,949
Փոխե՞մ ալիքը։ — Ոնց հարմար է։

71
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,390
Գուցէ ջո՞ւր։

72
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,989
Լաւ։

73
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,278
Մերսի։

74
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,957
Մի քիչ է՞լ։ — Հա։

75
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,956
Գորի֊ում ի՞նչ գործի ես։

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,872
Բուժքոյր եմ։

77
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,999
Իսկ դո՞ւ։ Ես դասատու եմ։

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,592
Իսկ ազատ ժամանակ

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,472
կանա՞նց ես բերում հիւրանոց։

80
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,509
Չէ։

81
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,028
Իրականում առաջին անգամ եմ այստեղ։

82
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,114
Չէ հա՞։ — Այո։

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,673
Իսկ Իւա՞ն։ — Իւան ի՞նչ։

84
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,910
Նա այստեղ եղե՞լ է։

85
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,749
Չգիտեմ, երեւի թէ։

86
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,520
Վաղո՞ւց էք ծանօթ։ — Հա։

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,195
Մանկութիւնից։

88
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,032
Միասին ենք մեծացել։

89
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,355
Նախկին ֆուտբոլի՞ստ է։

90
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,710
Այո, լաւ խաղացող էր։

91
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,312
Ինքը նոյնիսկ խաղում էր

92
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,596
«Դինամո Թբիլիսի»֊ում։

93
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,917
Յետոյ թարգեց։

94
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,399
Համոզեցի դպրոցում աշխատի

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,676
որպէս մարզիչ։

96
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,997
Համաձայնեց երկար արձակուրդի համար։

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,959
Աշխատավարճը ցածր է

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,712
բայց արձակուրդը երկար։

99
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,958
Ու երեխաներն են նրան սիրում։

100
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,711
Ի՞նչ եղաւ։ — Ոչինչ։

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,551
Էլի ջուր կուզե՞ս։

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,518
Ի՞նչ ես անում։

103
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,316
Ի՞նչ է պատահել։

104
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,553
Կներես։

105
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,471
Ոչինչ։ — Կներես։

106
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,276
Նորմալ է։

107
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,756
Աւելի լա՞ւ ես։

108
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,875
Չեմ հաւատում։

109
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,109
Դէ ժպտա։

110
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,028
Այո։

111
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,271
Ի՞նչ պաստառներ։

112
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,035
Մեքենայի մէջ են։

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,754
Լաւ, ես կը բերեմ։ Լաւ։

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,997
Ուզո՞ւմ ես գնանք մարզադաշտ

115
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,195
ֆուտբոլ նայելու։

116
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,759
Ես չեմ սիրում ֆուտբոլ։

117
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,876
Սովորական ֆուտբոլ չի։

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,435
Կանացի ֆուտբոլ է։

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,235
Գորի֊ում աղջիկները ֆուտբոլ չեն խաղում։

120
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,719
Թբիլիսիյում խաղում են։

121
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,955
Մանանա, պաստառը տուր։

122
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,439
Ու զանգուլակը։

123
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,598
Կանգնիր կողքիս։

124
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,318
Մանանան լինելու է դիրիժոր։

125
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,515
Պաստառները լաւ են երեւում

126
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,591
եթէ դրանք միասին են բարձրանում։

127
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,432
Երբ մերոնք յարձակւում են

128
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,589
բարձրացնում ենք։

129
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,153
Իջեցնում ենք։

130
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,639
Երբ գոլ են խփում

131
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,153
թափ ենք տալիս։

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,638
Նորից փորձենք։

133
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,953
Մանանա, կհաւաքե՞ս պաստառները

134
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,395
խաղից յետոյ։ — Լաւ։

135
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,832
Հիանալի տեսք ունես։ — Մերսի։

136
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,199
Երբ դպրոցի տնօրէնը

137
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,793
աւարտի խօսքը, բարձրացրէք։

138
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,871
Ի՜ւա։ — Եկայ, եկայ։

139
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,397
Ինչպէս գիտէք,

140
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,668
Կանանց ֆուտբոլը

141
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,195
մեր երկրում նորոյթ է։

142
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,035
Մինչ վերջերս միայն տղամարդկանց խաղ էր։

143
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,318
Բայց ժամանակը փոխւում է։

144
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,708
Փոխւում է եւ կնոջ դերը

145
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,552
նաեւ հասարակութեան մէջ։

146
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,673
Մենք դառնում ենք աւելի ակտիւ

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,833
աւելի եռանդուն, ձգտող, աշխոյժ,

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,755
ուզում ենք աւելի շատ գոլեր խփել կեանքում։

149
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,354
Չեմ սիրում

150
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,238
երեխայիս մենակ թողնել։

151
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,038
Ի՞նչ տարիքի է։ — 13։

152
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,160
Տղա՞յ է թէ աղջիկ։ — Տղայ։

153
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,511
Իսկ ո՞ւր է հայրը։ — Գորիյում։

154
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,352
Ի՞նչ գործի է։

155
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,353
Ոչ մի։ Խմում է

156
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,158
յետոյ կռիւ անում։

157
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,996
Բաժանո՞ւած էք։

158
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,788
Արդէն երկու տարի է։

159
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,149
Անհնար է իր հետ ապրել։

160
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,189
Ամէն ինչ ջարդուփշուր է անում։

161
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,392
Ինձ էլ էր ծեծում։

162
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,034
Անցեալ անգամ

163
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,679
եկել էր ու սաղ աւիրել։

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,752
Ինքն իրեն կտրեց ապակով

165
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,433
ու շուրժը արիւնոտեց։

166
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,351
Որդուն վախեցրեց։

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,036
Գորիի աւտոբուսը մեկնում է։

168
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,919
Զբաղեցրէք տեղերը։

169
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,396
Կարող եմ յաջորդ ուրբաթ գալ։

170
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,834
Ուզո՞ւմ ես գամ։

171
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,635
Այո, իհարկէ։ — Աշխատո՞ւմ ես ուրբաթ օրը։

172
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,917
Մինչեւ երկուսը։

173
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,679
Ապա ես գա՞մ երեքին։

174
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,273
Մակային էլ կը բերեմ։

175
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,557
Հաւէս կը լինէր։

176
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,833
Խմա՞ծ է։

177
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,752
Կարծես թէ չէ։

178
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,799
Խմած չեմ։

179
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,871
Խմա՞ծ չես։ Ապրես։

180
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,712
Ո՞ւր էիր էդքան ժամանակ։ — Չի ուզում ասել։

181
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,272
Դպրոցում։

182
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,077
Աղջիկների թիմն էր խաղում։

183
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,789
Հանրաճանաչ լեհ

184
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,279
մարզիկ էր եկել։

185
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,998
Կի՞ն։ — Այո։

186
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,793
Սիրո՞ւն էր։

187
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,074
Չեմ սիրում

188
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,118
մկանոտ կին ֆուտբոլիստների։

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,991
Նոյնիսկ մի խօսէք դրանցից։

190
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,958
Մարինայի որդին լեհի հետ է ամուսնացել

191
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,953
ու պարզուեց որ նա լաւ կին է։

192
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,115
Ֆուտբոլի՞ստ է։

193
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,275
Չէ, բժիշկ է։

194
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,589
Բժիշկ կինը լաւ է։

195
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,432
Բայց նա կամուսնանա՞յ բժշկի հետ։

196
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,272
Մենակ չգիտես ուր թրեւ է գալիս։

197
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,755
Թրեւ չեմ գալիս։ — Գալիս ես, գալիս ես։

198
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,035
Այսօր, մարզադաշտում

199
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,235
կնոջ հետ եմ ծանօթացել։

200
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,674
Լեհի հե՞տ։

201
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,873
Չէ, Գորիից է։

202
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,152
Ինչի՞ Գորիից։ Թիֆլիսում քի՞չ կանայք կան։

203
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,311
Ի՞նչ կապ ունի որտեղից է։

204
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,435
Մեծ կապ ունի։

205
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,631
Դու էլ էիր գաւառից

206
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,199
երբ հայրիկին ամուսնացար։

207
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,430
Լա՞ւ չէր։ — Այո, լաւ չէր։

208
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,079
Ես պէտք է նրան ամէն ինչ սովորեցնէի։

209
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,673
Էդ ո՞վ էր ում սովորեցնում։

210
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,400
Ես քեզ՝ ինչպէս պահել սեղանի մօտ։

211
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,516
Ինչպէս պատառաքաղը բռնել։

212
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,789
Լաւ էլի։

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,956
Ի՞նչ էր այդ կինը մարզադաշտում կորցրել։

214
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,951
Եկել էր խաղը նայելու։

215
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,076
Հը՞։ — Խաղն էր նայում։

216
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,992
Ուզում ես ասել, նա յատուկ եկել է

217
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,149
Գորիից որ նայի

218
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,675
ոնց են աղջիկները ֆուտբոլ խաղո՞ւմ։

219
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,917
Գի՞ժ է։

220
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,350
Մենակ խաղի համար չէր եկել։

221
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,475
Բա էլ ինչի՞ համար։

222
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,437
Հանդիպում ունէր։

223
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,798
Գնա՞ց հետ։

224
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,349
Գնաց։ — Ուղեկցեցի՞ր։

225
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,034
Հա։ — Հետ գալո՞ւ է։

226
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,196
Տեսնենք, գուցէ։

227
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,635
Իսկ դու նրան կհանդիպե՞ս։

228
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,269
Երեւի։

229
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,954
Մենակ էդ գիտի՝

230
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,314
«գուցէ, երեւի,

231
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,318
տեսնենք»։

232
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,392
Մի բան արա, տղաս։

233
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,433
Մենք ծերանում ենք։

234
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,950
Նա էլ է ծերանում։ Արդէն 40 է։

235
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,479
Մեքենան կանգնեցրի՞ր։

236
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,070
Հա, խանութի մօտ։

237
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,875
Ոչ թէ աւտոտնա՞կ։

238
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,156
Աւտոտնակ վաղը կը տանեմ։

239
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,310
Վաղը մեզ կը տուգանեն։

240
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,238
Կրկին։ — Ես կը վճարեմ։

241
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,435
Դու երբեք չես վճարում։

242
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,794
Միշտ ես եմ վճարում։

243
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,951
Այս անգամ ես կը վճարեմ։ — Հա՞։

244
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,519
Աշխատավարձը կը ստանամ ու կը վճարեմ։

245
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,352
Ինչ֊որ երբեք չեմ տեսել աշխատավարձդ։

246
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,199
Ո՜վ կը մտածէր որ

247
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,749
40 տարեկանում դեռ ամուրի կը լինես։

248
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,069
Մամ, վերջացրու։

249
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,434
Երբ դու դառնաս հայր

250
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,397
կհասկանաս ինչի միջով եմ անցնում։

251
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,994
Կը լինի՞ հանգիստ ուտեմ։

252
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,549
Աւելացնե՞մ։ — Չէ, շնորհակալութիւն։

253
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,915
Օթար, օթար, գնա՛նք։

254
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,156
Ահա, հիմա նրան չես արթնացնի։

255
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,230
Օգնիր։

256
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,075
Օթար, վեր կաց։

257
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,233
Հազիւ քնել էի…

258
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,431
Տարա՞ր կայրան։

259
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,719
Այո։ — Ե՞ւ։

260
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,909
Ուզում է ուրբաթ գալ։

261
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,595
Ընկերուհու հե՞տ։ — Այո։

262
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,520
Հիանալի։ Միասին էլ կը զբօսնենք։

263
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,195
Ես չեմ գալու։

264
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,793
Գի՞ժ ես։

265
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,029
Քո համար է գալիս։

266
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,634
Երեւի սիրահարուել է։

267
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,236
Այդ պատճառով էլ չեմ գալու։

268
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,911
Կարծում ես, լա՞ւն ես իր համար։

269
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,953
Գնա՛նք Քոբուլեթի։

270
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,031
Յոգնել եմ Թիֆլիսից։

271
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,399
Ի՞նչ անենք Քոբուլեթիում։

272
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,198
Սիրուն է այնտեղ հիմա։

273
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,990
Թարմ օդ կը շնչենք։

274
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,151
Քեռուս մօտ կը մնանք։

275
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,395
Հայրիկ, կարո՞ղ եմ

276
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,959
հանգստեան օրերին մեքենան վերցնել։

277
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,031
Ո՞ւր ես ուզում գնալ։ — Քոբուլեթի։

278
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,955
Նոյեմբերին Քոբուլե՞թի։

279
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,348
Գի՞ժ ես։

280
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,757
Մարդաշատ չի, լաւ եղանակ է։

281
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,195
Գուցէ նոյնիսկ լողանք։

282
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,634
Կոկորդդ մրսում է

283
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,916
սառը մանդարիններից։

284
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,752
Եթէ լողաս,

285
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,876
Թոքերի բորբոքում կը ստանաս, հաստատ։

286
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,995
Մի խառնուիր իր կեանքի մէջ

287
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,639
Նա 40 տարեկան է։

288
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,597
Իսկ դու մի խառնուիր մեր զրոյցին։

289
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,030
Եթէ ուզում ես երբեւէ ամուսնանայ,

290
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,838
թող նրան հանգիստ, ինչքա՞ն կարելի է։

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,718
Անցեալ տարի վերցրին մեքենան,

292
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,757
Խմեցին, ու ջարդեցին այն։

293
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,195
Քեռի Օթար, այս անգամ չենք խմի։

294
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,794
Թարմ օդ կը շնչենք, մարմնամարզութեամբ կը զբաղուենք։

295
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,077
Ապա մենք էլ ձեզ հետ։

296
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,559
Մե՞նք ինչի։ — Մեզ էլ թարմ օդը

297
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,948
վնաս չէ։

298
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,997
Համ էլ կհետեւենք որ չխմեն

299
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,152
ու որեւէ տհաճ պատմութեան մէջ չընկնեն։

300
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,110
Ծովի հոտ է։

301
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,510
Ո՞նց ես։ — Լաւ, դո՞ւ։

302
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,319
Ի՜նչ գեղեցկուհի

303
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,630
ես դարձել։

304
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,916
Ո՞նց ես։ — Լաւ, դո՞ւք։

305
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,430
Բարեւ, քոյրիկ։ Ո՞նց ես։

306
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,148
Բարեւ, Աւտո։ — Աւտանդիլ, լա՞ւ ես։

307
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,076
Ո՞նց է ընտանիքը։ — Լաւ։

308
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,832
Սա իմ ընկերուհի Հատունան է։

309
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,471
Իմ եղբայր Սանդրոն։ Շատ հաճելի է։

310
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,471
Իր ընկերն է, Իւան։

311
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,671
Ինչ հաւէս ընկերուհի ունես։

312
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Ինչո՞ւ էիր նրան թաքցնում։

313
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,912
Արդեն ֆլիրտում է։

314
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,914
Բարեւ ձեզ — Հաճելի է։

315
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,835
Կինս։ — Բարով եկաք։

316
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,911
Երեկոյեան կը տեսնուե՞նք։

317
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,433
Հա՞։ — Իհարկէ։

318
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,238
Մեզ մօտ հիւր կը գայ։

319
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,359
Լաւ, ցտեսութիւն։ — Մինչ երեկոյ։

320
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,675
We go to the beach, you come?

321
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,671
I expect a friend

322
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,955
may be later.

323
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,832
It also comes? - Yes.

324
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,349
What a great place to land!

325
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,916
Աննան չի՞։

326
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,388
Նա է։ Ի՞նչ է այստեղ անում։

327
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,633
Աննա՜

328
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,875
Մարզիչ Իւա, Սանդրո, ո՞նց էք։

329
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,314
Լաւ ենք։

330
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,319
Ի՞նչ ես այստեղ անում, բալիկ ջան։

331
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,674
Մայրիկն եկել է

332
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,029
աշխատանքի պատճառով։

333
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,396
Ո՞նց ես։ — Լաւ։

334
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,152
Մայրիկդ է՞լ է այստեղ։

335
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,548
Yes, I call it.

336
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,470
It makes me so happy to see you!

337
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,032
US too.

338
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,192
Can we join you?

339
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,953
Naturally.

340
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,997
Ո՞նց ես։ — Լաւ։

341
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,957
Շատ հաճելի է քեզ այստեղ տեսնել։

342
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,957
My best football mom does not leave me,

343
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,111
even during the holidays.

344
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,958
What are you doing here?

345
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,155
Ընկերուհիս այստեղ փակել է

346
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,117
գեղեցկութեան սրահ։

347
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,198
Ինձ գործիքներն է թողել։

348
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,839
and I'm here to recover them.

349
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,276
Դու գեղեցկութեան սրահո՞ւմ ես աշխատում։

350
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,634
Հա, ես վարսավիր եմ։

351
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,191
Anna, I throw the ball.

352
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,633
Խաղա՞նք։

353
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,514
Արի։

354
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,074
Anna throws the ball!

355
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,358
Let's play!

356
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,671
My mom and me against you two.

357
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,548
Anna, larger stones.

358
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,794
Here are our goals. - Here our own.

359
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,632
It seems a little small.

360
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,028
It will go.

361
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,395
Completed?

362
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,073
Where are you?

363
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,195
Both, mother and daughter.

364
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,353
And going on!

365
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,153
Goal!

366
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,839
Leave him.

367
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,957
I have to quit.

368
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,196
He scored.

369
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,552
It is good.

370
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,194
No compromise in sport.

371
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,351
That's what I taught them.

372
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,354
It's not badminton, but football.

373
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,719
What I taught you?

374
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,552
Did I learn anything?

375
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,992
Go! Anna!

376
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,474
Happening, I let you shoot.

377
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,039
Goal!

378
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,029
I can not stand it, I'm tired.

379
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,192
Congratulations.

380
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,271
You can not play better?

381
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,908
Let's eat.

382
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,559
We could take that

383
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,472
protect themselves from the rain? - Why not?

384
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,589
You can sit anywhere.

385
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,557
Thank you.

386
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,832
My sweet! Please, bring us

387
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,797
the tchatcha (Georgian vodka)!

388
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,997
So katchapuri and double lemonade.

389
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,598
Manana. - Yes?

390
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,149
After the game,

391
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,759
Have you recovered all panels?

392
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,599
Yes, that was difficult. - What for?

393
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,676
Two types would not make

394
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,910
without receiving my phone number.

395
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,228
And what have you done?

396
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,197
I gave them my number.

397
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,590
Had they known the jealousy of my husband,

398
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,035
they have not asked.

399
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,432
You are married?

400
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,233
Yes and no.

401
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,832
He is in prison. We have

402
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,718
a telephone appointment a week.

403
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,514
Yes, Father? - Where are you?

404
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,635
You are not ashamed?

405
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,755
We met friends

406
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,069
and we stayed together.

407
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,071
What friends? - Here, these girls

408
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,639
have already been waiting an hour.

409
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,360
We'll arrive soon. - Right now!

410
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,639
Hear them sing so.

411
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,599
Anna, come here, you will be soaked.

412
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,435
When you're leaving? - Tomorrow.

413
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,150
Pity.

414
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,269
We could have done

415
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,634
a stroll.

416
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,516
I'm on duty tomorrow

417
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,240
and I have to leave early.

418
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,473
I wish I could stay.

419
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,312
We could go fishing.

420
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,948
I'm never going fishing.

421
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,389
Long life to this place!

422
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,753
Bravo!

423
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,632
Honey!

424
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,398
We are going there?

425
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,918
Did you pay?

426
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,349
Bye.

427
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,630
A beautiful girl

428
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,149
waited for you for five hours

429
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,599
With his friends,

430
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,593
and she might have changed your life.

431
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,671
But you'd rather wander

432
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,114
and you get drunk.

433
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,118
We are not souls.

434
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,315
If you are.

435
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,274
So tell me

436
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,112
what you really want?

437
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,878
Is this any way to behave?

438
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,834
Look at me when I talk to you.

439
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,593
What kind of people are you?

440
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,799
Where did you grow up?

441
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,909
I'd really like to know.

442
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,510
What is your purpose in life?

443
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,789
Father, calm down.

444
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,190
What do you do with your life?

445
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,197
I really would like to know.

446
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,196
Otar, do not drink.

447
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,389
Did you say something?

448
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,073
You should not drink.

449
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,038
What did you say?

450
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,908
There tea. - We come.

451
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,518
The tea will not help us.

452
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,677
Hi, how are you?

453
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,429
Good and you? - Good.

454
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,319
How was the return? - Good and you?

455
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,633
I'm a bit tired.

456
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,233
You came back later?

457
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,310
Not really.

458
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,031
Did you bring the panels?

459
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,708
Yes I do . Where is Iva?

460
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,950
No idea. I wait.

461
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,348
Carry signs

462
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,748
in my class.

463
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,513
Okay.

464
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,918
Here's a few.

465
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,759
Much?

466
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,591
Have you class today? - Yes.

467
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,956
I disturb? - No.

468
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,632
The school is great.

469
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,198
What school did you go?

470
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,349
Evening classes.

471
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,039
The last year of school,

472
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,553
I did not go to class.

473
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,189
Why?

474
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,836
I was pregnant with Anna.

475
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,315
I often missed school.

476
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,591
I even had nightmares prof

477
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,472
put me on the board to punish me.

478
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,839
What are you doing here Mom?

479
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,230
I reported the panels.

480
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,472
Come home. - You are crazy?

481
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,790
Come home. - Anna!

482
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,910
I said, go home!

483
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,593
I hate these panels!

484
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,516
Why are you silent? Who is it?

485
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,352
The King Erekle.

486
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,949
Which? - Erekle II.

487
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,508
Erekle II was one

488
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,114
the most beloved of Georgian kings.

489
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,670
The people loved him.

490
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,992
He even gave him a nickname.

491
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,351
You remember? - Small Kakhi.

492
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,590
Just. Why small? - He was small.

493
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,076
In fact,

494
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,477
there is a popular poem about this king.

495
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,630
I'd like to recite it.

496
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,996
But I forgot it.

497
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,711
Could you refresh my memory?

498
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,795
Manana, I would

499
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,359
hear you tell me.

500
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,470
Our king is called Little Kakhi.

501
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,995
He took his armor

502
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,513
and cut in pieces with his bare hands.

503
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,313
Thank you.

504
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,915
May I ask you for help?

505
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,870
Who is it?

506
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,759
It is my great-grandfather Nikipore.

507
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,916
Do you know why his ear bandaged?

508
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,755
Once he ran into the forêtt

509
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,150
and a beautiful woman called him by name.

510
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,751
But he could not hear.

511
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,716
At night, they are seen at a party.

512
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,472
And she insulted

513
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,358
not to have heard.

514
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,557
Nikipore had warm blood,

515
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,358
he cut off the ear with a dagger.

516
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,794
He said she was useless

517
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,837
if he could not hear anything with it.

518
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,558
You would cut off the ear you

519
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,119
for a woman?

520
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,074
It depends on the woman.

521
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,912
And if I called you?

522
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,430
Call me. - Sandro! - What?

523
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,797
You did not have to hear me.

524
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,077
Okay, still calls me once.

525
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,559
Sandro!

526
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,797
See you tomorrow?

527
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,678
I can not.

528
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,994
My husband leaves prison.

529
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,196
He would stay there four years

530
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,793
but he released earlier.

531
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,989
He 36

532
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,037
and was already in prison twice.

533
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,710
The first time because he had

534
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,235
stung a friend with a fork.

535
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,314
He thought the guy

536
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,391
flirting with me.

537
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,838
How did you meet?

538
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,477
I was going to school. I was 14.

539
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,639
He saw me in the street

540
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,199
and I liked it.

541
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,311
I liked so many boys.

542
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,072
But once began Tengo

543
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,310
to accompany me home

544
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,595
and me gifts,

545
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,751
all other suitors are gone.

546
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,596
And I got pregnant.

547
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,513
Anna was 5 years old when he was imprisoned.

548
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,430
He stayed there four years and then went out.

549
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,798
This year, he returned it.

550
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,476
What happened this time?

551
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,511
He fought.

552
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,512
You love it?

553
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,353
I once loved.

554
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,431
Now I'm safer.

555
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,629
I'm tired of these problems.

556
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,910
He tries to change,

557
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,991
but did not succeed.

558
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,276
He also has bad luck, probably.

559
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,475
I do not know.

560
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,317
I'm going to talk to him.

561
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,755
I never am

562
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,797
felt better with someone.

563
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,033
Never.

564
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,756
All my life,

565
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,359
I went to the sea,

566
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,116
but I do remember the day

567
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,793
I spent with you.

568
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,716
I do not care who your husband

569
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,110
Moved with his fork.

570
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,029
If you want it,

571
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,519
we will get together.

572
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,197
I talk to him first.

573
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,430
But not now.

574
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,551
I need time.

575
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,030
I drive you to prison.

576
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,672
Okay.

577
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,752
I have to go now.

578
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,839
Sandro.

579
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,593
Please, as soon as I go down.

580
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,236
Would you katchapuri?

581
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,276
No thanks.

582
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,277
Okay, I'll take it anyway.

583
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,950
How much does it cost? - 80 tetri.

584
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,593
Thank you.

585
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,629
Is katchapuri good?

586
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,755
Not bad.

587
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,239
You see, give me money.

588
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,675
How much does it cost? - 80.

589
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,959
Take this.

590
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,877
Let's go to the bus stop.

591
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,995
We also see the bus

592
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,559
from here. Sit down.

593
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,159
The katchapuri is good.

594
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,558
It's for me?

595
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,237
He is handsome.

596
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,511
Do you like him? - Yes.

597
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,034
I asked the young in there

598
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,519
to do for you.

599
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,159
Thank you.

600
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,913
When my cellmate

601
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,354
saw it, he liked it so much

602
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,272
it also makes it and make a

603
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,476
requested me to go give it to his mother.

604
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,549
This time, I will do everything correctly.

605
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,717
Do you believe me or not?

606
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,072
But what does he do?

607
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,357
Who cares what he does.

608
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,718
What he's looking for here?

609
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,471
It is stuck to the outside.

610
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,399
I will help.

611
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,515
Where are you going?

612
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,669
I will help.

613
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,671
Forget it, it'll make it right.

614
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,875
What's up with you?

615
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,189
I only want to help.

616
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,634
Leave him there will come itself.

617
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,631
It will not do. - We miss the bus.

618
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,631
Calm down, do not get excited.

619
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,313
I do not get angry, get back.

620
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,390
I told you

621
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,754
you should calm down.

622
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,277
To hell.

623
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,158
It is closed old man?

624
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,956
Yes, I left my keys inside.

625
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,039
Hold that.

626
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,033
And that too, please.

627
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,515
Hot katchapuri.

628
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,557
You buy hot katchapuri!

629
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,435
Katchapuri!

630
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,191
Good God.

631
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,198
Here you are.

632
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,438
Thank you. - You're welcome.

633
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,600
Are you in town? - Yes.

634
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,399
Can you take us

635
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,834
my wife and I?

636
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,629
Okay? - Okay.

637
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,951
Manana, go, come on.

638
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,236
What is there? - Nothing.

639
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,516
So kiss me.

640
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,315
What is wrong?

641
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,833
I did not miss You?

642
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,634
It makes me uncomfortable. - What for?

643
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,958
It's natural for someone

644
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,951
who just released from prison.

645
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,758
He's busy driving.

646
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,830
Relax.

647
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,269
Have you got a cigarette?

648
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,476
Thank you. And a lighter?

649
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,718
Thank you.

650
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,270
You make the taxi surcharge?

651
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,351
Occasionally.

652
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,879
I need a car today.

653
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,192
I will pay you and give

654
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,998
money for gasoline.

655
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,111
Where do you want to go?

656
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,474
You just get out.

657
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,198
Can not you not stay today?

658
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,998
I gotta get out, it's urgent.

659
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,115
What is there?

660
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,269
Why is this important?

661
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,668
That's a deal.

662
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,435
I want to know. - Relax.

663
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,310
So what do you say?

664
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,593
It is good.

665
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,551
Great.

666
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,272
I feel bad.

667
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,871
What is there? - I do not know,

668
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,632
I need fresh air.

669
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,234
Please, stop! - We are almost there.

670
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,628
I told you I felt bad

671
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,199
and I needed fresh air.

672
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,952
Stopped. - What is wrong?

673
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,390
I feel bad . I need air!

674
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,553
Thank you.

675
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,553
Good God.

676
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,114
Wait in the yard. I get on.

677
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,477
Throw the ball.

678
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,073
Ready?

679
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,479
Good job .

680
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,393
I have a wonderful girl!

681
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,037
You know how to catch, huh?

682
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,110
Do not let

683
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,269
you drag hands.

684
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,711
You make me fall.

685
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,869
No problem.

686
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,793
Natia!

687
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,509
How are you? - Good.

688
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,955
You're not cold?

689
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,109
Let's sit in the car.

690
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,190
There is the sun.

691
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,395
Come on then!

692
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,836
Hello. - Hello.

693
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,431
This is my friend Sandro.

694
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,359
Enchanted.

695
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,553
Sandro, could you leave us

696
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,438
alone, we need to talk.

697
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,233
How are you? - I'm fine.

698
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,994
You're in what month? - At the third.

699
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,957
Does your family know?

700
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,230
Yes I do.

701
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,073
Do they know it's me? - No.

702
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,191
My wife does she know anything?

703
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,558
No. - Really? - No.

704
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,278
Natia, listen to me.

705
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,190
I hate to talk about it,

706
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,078
but you have to understand me.

707
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,279
I can not take

708
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,158
all the baby's responsibility.

709
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,713
I'll help, of course.

710
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,433
I can not do much,

711
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,556
I just got out of prison.

712
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,352
I have no work, no perspective.

713
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,189
Everything is upside down.

714
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,393
What should I say,

715
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,437
I hate abortions.

716
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,749
But have we

717
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,194
alternatively?

718
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,959
I do not avorterai.

719
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,269
I do not want it.

720
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,152
I can understand, but

721
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,470
There he has another alternative?

722
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,274
I do not know, but

723
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,078
I do not avorterai.

724
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,393
The money I make it my business.

725
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,471
I'll bring you the best doctor.

726
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,676
You get out unharmed, do not worry.

727
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,950
I do not want your money. - Stopped.

728
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,156
Okay, you did not need money.

729
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,117
Okay, you do not want an abortion.

730
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,554
Me neither, I hate that, but

731
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,119
this is the only possibility.

732
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,833
Otherwise, you propose what else?

733
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,274
I do not do it.

734
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,634
Listen to me Natia.

735
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,276
Come to this address.

736
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,833
My condolences.

737
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,154
My sincere condolences.

738
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,038
Are you the mother of Zaza? - Yes.

739
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,394
I am a friend of Zaza.

740
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,278
I come directly from prison.

741
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,352
He do this for you

742
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,476
and requested me to bring it to you.

743
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,917
How nice! Thank you very much!

744
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,992
Nuzgar calls.

745
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,113
How is my son? - Uncle Nuzgar!

746
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,509
Uncle Nuzgar, Natela calling you.

747
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,716
Thank you, you have made me

748
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,836
so happy.

749
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,670
See the care of my son.

750
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,271
What is going on? - Zaza sent me

751
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,152
a ring from prison.

752
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,992
This man is his friend.

753
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,719
Hello.

754
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,871
You were in prison with Zaza? - Yes.

755
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,871
When did you get out? - Today.

756
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,988
Congratulations. - Thank you.

757
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,435
Hello.

758
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,749
You have a momentt

759
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,239
to talk about Zaza?

760
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,715
It's certain. - Please, come.

761
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,717
What is it, Nuzgar?

762
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,439
He was in prison with Zaza

763
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,999
and it came out today.

764
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,071
Come in.

765
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,718
I'll be right back.

766
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,428
Girls, leave us alone for a while.

767
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,555
Have you phoned

768
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,995
for meat? - It makes the Soso.

769
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,228
So how are you?

770
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,630
I just got out.

771
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,997
I take my freedom.

772
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,829
Nuzgar, look at these beautiful fish.

773
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,989
Which specimen.

774
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,115
This is what we serve

775
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,474
during the vigil.

776
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,993
Viewing see.

777
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,878
It's fresh.

778
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,478
He made me a special price.

779
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,358
How many? - First, he said 20 Lari.

780
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,317
But we agreed to 18.

781
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,113
Like a catfish,

782
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,872
we will receive tomorrow

783
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,469
fresh from the Alasani.

784
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,235
Fish is good. - Good, but expensive.

785
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,389
We need

786
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,391
at least 20kg, is not it? - Yes.

787
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,632
You will not find cheaper.

788
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,074
We'll talk later.

789
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,309
Seller of fish

790
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,754
awaits our response.

791
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,035
It will sell

792
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,589
perhaps someone else.

793
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,590
That seems still expensive.

794
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,274
Nothing but fish costs 400.

795
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,990
With catfish ...

796
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,993
this is 800. - Here we go.

797
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,276
What are we doing?

798
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,351
Maybe should I buy carp.

799
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,556
Excuse me if I interfere,

800
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,039
These are not my things.

801
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,235
I think that would be enough

802
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,674
with only one kind of fish.

803
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,319
Why?

804
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,315
Zaza needs money in prison.

805
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,117
Zaza needs money? Why?

806
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,271
He lost cards.

807
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,509
He must pay today.

808
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,277
Zaza has played and lost?

809
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,908
He is a believer, it is not possible

810
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,109
he played.

811
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,991
He often visits the priest.

812
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,958
I know but he still played.

813
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,916
I must visit him in prison.

814
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,718
He has not played for ages.

815
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,949
How would this be this possible?

816
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,838
Calm down, give him a visit.

817
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,877
That's what I say.

818
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,271
I know you're short of money.

819
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,795
Two types of fish are useless.

820
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,915
A sufficient.

821
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,149
In addition, we could

822
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,469
reflect on other points.

823
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,039
It's a tricky thing.

824
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,031
I saw the coffin at the entrance.

825
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,356
And? - It is an expensive coffin.

826
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,669
Maybe we pourraitt

827
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,637
exchange it against cheaper.

828
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,951
What the hell are you talking about ?!

829
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,590
We think about something else.

830
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,318
Where stands the funeral meal?

831
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,390
In a restaurant.

832
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,073
How much is it per person?

833
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,275
20 Lari. - 20 Lari?

834
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,271
And we make our wine.

835
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,959
20 Lari with your own wine?

836
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,155
It's way too much.

837
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,311
How many people are invited?

838
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,869
250 - 250?

839
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,756
We can prepare a table in the courtyard?

840
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,239
You have a yard, is not it?

841
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,913
Yes I do. - Once on the other side.

842
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,672
Look to see.

843
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,632
We go up a tent in the courtyard.

844
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,552
Who still uses a tent today?

845
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,675
Why not?

846
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,638
The weather is nice. There is plenty of room.

847
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,438
We provide wooden tables and benches.

848
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,715
Overlaid with paper.

849
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,438
Lari 400 should suffice.

850
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,068
I work benches. - And or?

851
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,389
250 guests 20 times Lari

852
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,118
per person, this is 5000.

853
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,679
In the court it would cost 500.

854
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,114
You would save a lot with that.

855
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,309
You would help Zara

856
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,959
and in addition there would money.

857
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,236
Do not tell us what to do.

858
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,628
We do this by themselves.

859
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,710
Listen, brother.

860
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,359
I do not tell you anything.

861
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,873
I am here to help.

862
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,031
If you do not need it, I'm going.

863
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,792
Okay, do not upset you,

864
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,996
he only give its opinion.

865
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,593
Yes, but it was moved.

866
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,671
Your son sent me here.

867
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,876
Our family is in penury!

868
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,393
I can see that, but do you believe

869
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,754
I can see mine pink?

870
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,114
I get out of prison.

871
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,077
Here's my discharge papers.

872
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,471
I have better things to do

873
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,518
than discussing funeral meal.

874
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,274
I'm only here to help Zaza.

875
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,037
It's for you to decide.

876
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,749
Let us help your son.

877
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,315
The priest arrived

878
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,038
for the funeral ceremony.

879
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,758
I arrive in a minute.

880
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,433
Okay, I'm going.

881
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,273
Should I come back in an hour?

882
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,157
Okay.

883
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,515
I scrape the bottom of the barrel

884
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,318
Zaza, but without warranty.

885
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,799
See you later.

886
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,428
Oh my God.

887
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,473
My apologies.

888
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,353
I am sorry.

889
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,317
Let's stay a little.

890
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,838
Thank you.

891
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,559
How are you?

892
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,032
Why do not you greet Sandro?

893
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,599
Hello.

894
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,551
We have 30 minutes.

895
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,190
Make us beautiful.

896
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,353
No thanks. - Come here.

897
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,916
It's the best hairdresser in town.

898
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,798
Sit down.

899
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,992
You do not have much to do

900
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,639
with her hair.

901
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,672
Would you wash your hair?

902
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,432
No. - Of course, he would.

903
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,236
You changed the store, is not it?

904
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,799
No.

905
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,194
These photos

906
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,918
were already there? - Yes.

907
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,274
Are you sure? - Yes.

908
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,511
That's fine then.

909
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,153
Do not smoke here. Go to the back.

910
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,279
Hi, Natia.

911
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,632
How are you?

912
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,072
I am happy to see you.

913
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,958
I have good news.

914
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,835
In an hour

915
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,877
I have 2000 lari for you.

916
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,518
I'm serious.

917
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,633
I do not force you to abort.

918
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,877
You must also understand my situation.

919
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,996
I go to jail.

920
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,477
But I have already 2000 lari for you.

921
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,278
We'll take care of the rest later.

922
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,714
Where is the problem?

923
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,871
Calm down only, okay?

924
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,833
Manana, where is the ashtray?

925
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,792
Yet it was here somewhere.

926
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,359
Manana, where is the ashtray?

927
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,158
What are you doing here?

928
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,110
Here is your pay for the week.

929
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,235
Do not come back.

930
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,753
Now outside.

931
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,672
What are you doing?

932
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,476
Get out of here.

933
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,551
What is there? What happened?

934
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,199
You caress my housekeeper

935
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,634
in my presence!

936
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,835
You are crazy?

937
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,793
for several hours.

938
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,075
What do you want?

939
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,633
Do you still have your whole head?

940
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,119
Nothing happened.

941
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,554
Look at me!

942
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,790
Nothing happened. Including?

943
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,636
Tengo, I beg you, go away! - What for?

944
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,354
Outside! - I swear. Listen to me.

945
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,112
Come here! - Leave me out!

946
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,675
Do not touch me!

947
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,875
Calm down. - Outside!

948
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,553
Do not touch me! - Calm down.

949
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,948
I told you, do not touch me!

950
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,553
You will catch the iron

951
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,630
on the head.

952
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,392
You are crazy? Go, go.

953
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,356
Behave. We are not alone.

954
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,110
How can you be jealous

955
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,759
Natia as a refugee?

956
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,433
Are you really mad or what?

957
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,828
Tengo, leave me alone.

958
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,228
Relax so.

959
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,549
Let go of my hand.

960
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,392
I détendrai when you're gone.

961
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,470
Are you sure? - Yes.

962
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,312
Sure? - Yes.

963
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,515
Do not hit me!

964
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,999
Then draws up!

965
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,229
You act

966
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,674
like a fool. - Outside!

967
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,400
You got a grain.

968
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,633
Demented.

969
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,435
No need to sit you.

970
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,352
I do not you will cut off their hair.

971
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,591
Are you married, Sandro?

972
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,073
No.

973
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,269
If you want my advice, do not get married.

974
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,512
Why?

975
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,114
I ended up in jail

976
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,269
because of my wife.

977
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,709
I do not know

978
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,950
what to do with this Natia.

979
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,870
She is pregnant

980
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,519
and does not want an abortion.

981
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,874
What can I do?

982
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,791
What happens with Zaza?

983
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,716
He played with Rezo and lost.

984
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,313
You remember Rezo?

985
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,232
Yes I do. But Rezo has a phone,

986
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,118
why he did not call himself?

987
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,190
There are more.

988
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,270
They found

989
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,953
put him four more years.

990
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,633
For possession of phone

991
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,755
and for games.

992
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,430
Why did they let you out?

993
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,039
You know I'll finish

994
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,110
to know the truth.

995
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,792
Listen, Nodar.

996
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,639
The prison administration knew everything.

997
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,837
That Rezo had a laptop and played.

998
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,319
It forced people,

999
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,799
to call their families

1000
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,870
to ask for money.

1001
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,519
The guards came and ditt

1002
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,590
than those

1003
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,073
does not denounce the players,

1004
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,559
take two more years.

1005
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,039
All were afraid of Rezo

1006
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,349
and held their tongue,

1007
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,272
but I was tired.

1008
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,956
If you got tired of Rezo,

1009
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,395
why you're worried about his money?

1010
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,634
In addition, Zaza stopped playing.

1011
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,233
He became a believer.

1012
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,715
There I really need money.

1013
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,680
And that's how you gonna have?

1014
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,470
You know I will refund

1015
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,790
soon as I can. You know me.

1016
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,189
I'll go talk to them

1017
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,032
You and you disappear.

1018
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,593
Right now.

1019
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,753
Bastard! - Do not touch me!

1020
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,588
Do not touch me!

1021
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,353
Hey you! Let him go,

1022
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,629
it is the driver.

1023
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,797
Go to your self. - Let me pass.

1024
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,190
I told you to go to the car.

1025
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,592
Leave him!

1026
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,950
I'll kill the bastard!

1027
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,357
So grab one!

1028
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,709
Leave me! - Standing!

1029
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,278
Get your hands!

1030
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,153
Spread the legs!

1031
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,268
It has nothing to do with it.

1032
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,668
Let it go!

1033
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,790
I'm his father.

1034
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,518
Let me explain.

1035
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,671
Wait a minute. - It is his father.

1036
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,239
Let him explain.

1037
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,992
He was freed

1038
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,111
Prison today.

1039
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,191
He came to the funeral and said

1040
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,117
my son had gambling debts.

1041
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,629
Do it quiet, I hear nothing.

1042
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,108
Checks his papers.

1043
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,599
He said that my son

1044
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,193
Lari 2000 would have lost the game.

1045
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,237
He said I had to give him the money.

1046
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,674
It was released today.

1047
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,876
Put him in the car, I will see that.

1048
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,917
My stepfather died,

1049
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,069
his grandfather.

1050
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,955
Please, remove the handcuffs.

1051
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,912
If his mother will

1052
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,274
a heart attack.

1053
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,032
His father died, his eldest son

1054
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,156
in prison and he with handcuffs.

1055
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,548
Leave me.

1056
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,757
Nodar, you're a hero.

1057
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,990
You saved us. - Thank you.

1058
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,469
I will not forget.

1059
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,831
Nodar, thanks. - You're welcome.

1060
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,673
We will always be your debtors.

1061
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,233
Why do you need money?

1062
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,277
For the family?

1063
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,073
Yes I do.

1064
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,429
I have money.

1065
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,272
I bring to your family.

1066
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,708
Give it to the guy,

1067
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,836
who came with me.

1068
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,035
Here, take this.

1069
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,273
Ciao.

1070
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,593
Sandro.

1071
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,269
Bring this to Natia,

1072
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,271
she lives among refugees.

1073
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,469
And take what I owe you.

1074
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,914
I do not want any money.

1075
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,512
Thank you.

1076
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,118
Hi guys. - Hello.

1077
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,596
Do you know where lives Natia?

1078
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,752
Natia how?

1079
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,229
The slim girl

1080
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,958
who works at the beauty salon.

1081
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,678
What do you want him?

1082
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,834
I have something to give. - What?

1083
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,757
And who are you? - His brother.

1084
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,353
What do you give him?

1085
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,112
Money.

1086
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,279
Follow me.

1087
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,149
Gela, all right? - Yes, I am fine.

1088
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,671
Here is my father.

1089
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,918
Dad, here. .. - Sandro.

1090
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,671
Irodi, sit down.

1091
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,999
Natia here? - Natia faitt

1092
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,991
shopping, she will be back soon.

1093
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,311
Sit down, Sandro.

1094
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,391
Dad, then rest and listen.

1095
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,357
What is it, son?

1096
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,152
Dad, this is the father of the child Natia.

1097
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,791
I hardly know her.

1098
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,109
I saw her only twice

1099
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,633
ten minutes.

1100
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,518
Twice ten minutes, huh?

1101
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,908
And you came

1102
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,990
to get her pregnant?

1103
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,229
Would you insinuate

1104
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,833
my sister is a whore?

1105
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,236
We are family, understand?

1106
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,753
So think before you speak.

1107
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,069
Calm down, son.

1108
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,116
You put pregnant

1109
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,389
in ten minutes?

1110
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,675
Gela, what is it?

1111
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,829
Tell her you're not

1112
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,989
pregnant with me.

1113
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,559
Gela, what do you want from him?

1114
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,948
He must take

1115
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,872
responsibility for his actions.

1116
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,359
What are you talking about?

1117
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,676
I hardly know.

1118
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,159
So what is he doing here?

1119
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,639
How do you want me to know?

1120
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,915
Did you say that

1121
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,433
Tengo's friend hath made pregnant.

1122
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,556
The did you say or not? - Yes, but.. .

1123
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,757
The did you or did you not say? - Yes.

1124
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,673
So here it is.

1125
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,115
If it's not him,

1126
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,554
what is he doing here?

1127
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:53,429
Have you ever seen Tengo friends to come here?

1128
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,795
And bring money?

1129
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,870
What is that?

1130
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,917
That's all you offer?

1131
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,069
We the refugees, we

1132
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,309
are not worth more than that?

1133
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,833
You sleep with our wives

1134
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,919
I'll put you to pieces!

1135
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:06,990
Go on, do it!

1136
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,752
I'll put you to pieces!

1137
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,319
Wait. Stopped.

1138
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,313
Aunt, I beg you, help me!

1139
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,799
What is happening here?

1140
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,757
Stand still for a moment.

1141
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,319
Wait, I'll explain.

1142
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,790
Tell me all. - I will tell you.

1143
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,959
She is pregnant.

1144
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,075
What are you saying?
1145
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,355
He got her pregnant.

1146
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,879
And he does not want to marry her.

1147
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,314
Is she pregnant by him?

1148
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,993
Yes I do.

1149
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,795
It's true what I hear?

1150
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,949
You are not ashamed?

1151
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,708
You refuse to be the father?

1152
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,156
Wait, do not interrupt me.

1153
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,519
Then you have no shame?

1154
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,031
You repudiated your own child?

1155
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,798
How can you push

1156
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,190
your child and this angel?

1157
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,430
So keep quiet!

1158
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,558
How can you push them?

1159
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,950
Answer me.

1160
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,236
You should be ashamed.

1161
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,799
Future father,

1162
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,592
a respectable man.

1163
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,837
A true Georgian.

1164
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,355
A true Georgian

1165
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,714
does not behave well.

1166
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,236
You should move mountains

1167
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,436
for your child.

1168
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,437
It is here, under your nose,

1169
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,079
and you do not want?

1170
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,753
Look me in the eyes!

1171
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,233
We trust you Sandro.

1172
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,389
Pay attention to them.

1173
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,195
Have my blessing, my children!

1174
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,913
God bless you.

1175
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,230
Do not turn off your mobile, Natia.

1176
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,038
Gela, everything is in order?

1177
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,792
Yes everything is fine.

1178
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,191
Why are they holding hands?

1179
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,635
The girls walk like that.

1180
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,472
Hello. - Hello.

1181
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,592
How are you, Lali? - Well, here Maka.

1182
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,356
I will. - Hold me the hand.

1183
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,478
Enchanted.

1184
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,916
The road was good? - Yes.

1185
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,794
And how are you? - Not bad.

1186
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,119
Let's go? Our car is outside.

1187
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,838
Maka Come, sit here.

1188
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,992
Sit Lali.

1189
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,112
It does not open.

1190
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,754
It's closed? - Most likely.

1191
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,032
Sit down.

1192
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,916
Hello, I called the 408.

1193
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,116
The balcony door did not open.

1194
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,193
Why I want to open it?

1195
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,078
I want to be open, that's all.

1196
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,034
You tell me

1197
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,519
that you're doomed?

1198
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,592
Listen, I pay the room

1199
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,512
because of the balcony and the view.

1200
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,553
I do not care,

1201
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,711
I want the view.

1202
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,916
I need the view.

1203
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,315
Well, find Tamila

1204
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,311
and send someone.

1205
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,032
I want the view!

1206
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,592
Idiots!

1207
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,949
They say it's cold

1208
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,270
and they condemned the balcony.

1209
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,119
Never mind anyway, I can not

1210
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,952
not enjoy the view.

1211
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,629
Describe me just what you see.

1212
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,276
Thus, it is more interesting.

1213
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,833
What I see here?

1214
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,391
I see the Old Town of Tbilisi.

1215
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,278
The city with many balconies.

1216
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,832
The Mtkvari River.

1217
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,748
It also runs in Gori, right? - Yes.

1218
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,233
Here it is different.

1219
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,992
She has more meandering.

1220
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,915
Barataschwili liked to walk here.

1221
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,640
Alone? - Alone.

1222
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,715
I can see

1223
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,438
Cathedral of the Trinity.

1224
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,398
You describe well.

1225
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,630
Come and sit next to me.

1226
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,632
I can not stay.

1227
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,230
Can you take a walk with me?

1228
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,079
I'll take you to the station

1229
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,918
if you want. I am sorry.

1230
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,993
Maka, I'm going.

1231
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,913
I'm waiting at the station.

1232
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,997
Iva, thou escorted?

1233
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,233
Of course.

1234
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,756
I take the bus at 7:00.

1235
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,389
If you do not catch it, call me.

1236
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,795
We then see in Gori.

1237
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,113
Ciao.

1238
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,348
Would you like something to drink? - No.

1239
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,277
A fruit. We have apples.

1240
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,991
Yes, I would like one.

1241
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,035
Do I peel?

1242
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,593
No, I'll do it myself.

1243
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,671
Really? - Yes.

1244
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,068
I need the room.

1245
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,958
Azerbaijanis are coming soon.

1246
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,997
They will eat the Chinkali to the balcony.

1247
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,559
I give you another room.

1248
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,631
No thanks. - Okay.

1249
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,030
The balcony door is doomed.

1250
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,358
We open.

1251
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,390
They disaientt

1252
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,198
we must give room.

1253
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,512
I heard it.

1254
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,750
Let's go? - Soon.

1255
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,838
Hello.

1256
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,592
Let's hear some noise of the city,

1257
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,273
then go.

1258
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:30,992
We Dance?

1259
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,151
But we have no music.

1260
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,309
It does not matter.

1261
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,910
You From?

1262
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,395
Or? - A Kobuleti.

1263
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,672
My mother asked me

1264
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,750
go take it.

1265
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,438
Why did you need me for that?

1266
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,670
To keep you awake on the road?

1267
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,273
Yes I do.

1268
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,951
I had a bad dream.

1269
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,873
I trained a team

1270
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,792
Blind footballers.

1271
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,592
I was severe.

1272
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,756
What do you have?

1273
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,631
Are you still depressed?

1274
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,513
Looks good.

1275
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,198
Something happened?

1276
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,799
Nothing important. - Tell me.

1277
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,597
A friend of mine was imprisoned.

1278
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,670
Her friend is pregnant.

1279
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,512
Which friend?

1280
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,232
I am your friend.

1281
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,791
I still have another one.

1282
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,751
We studied together.

1283
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,711
It will probably be for five years.

1284
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,790
Her friend made me sad.

1285
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,315
She is pregnant and does not know where to go.

1286
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,997
I took it with me.

1287
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,030
There is a woman with you?

1288
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,593
Yes I do.

1289
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,113
And she will stay five years with you

1290
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,872
until the guy so?

1291
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,270
Why do not you marry it?

1292
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,436
She looks ready for that.

1293
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,230
I must tell you something.

1294
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,355
What is it?

1295
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,710
We have a guest.

1296
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,671
A woman - a friend of mine.

1297
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,116
She will stay with us a while.

1298
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,998
Who is she?

1299
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,355
Only a friend.

1300
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,715
You could also

1301
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,359
up to something else.

1302
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,469
What do you mean?

1303
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,039
It is just a friend.

1304
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,551
A friend lives in you

1305
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,029
in our presence - for a moment.

1306
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,428
I've never heard

1307
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,794
talk about what kind of friendship.

1308
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,077
You know her?

1309
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,593
No.

1310
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,556
Who are his parents?

1311
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,913
It is not Tbilisi.

1312
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,115
I'm fed up

1313
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,429
thy rustic.

1314
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,556
Besides a man intelligentt

1315
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,314
should marry a girl from the province.

1316
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,391
Including?

1317
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,715
Why marry?

1318
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,472
I will not marry her.

1319
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,596
So keep it to yourself.

1320
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,710
How old?

1321
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,352
Around 25 years.

1322
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,318
How are you? You're bored? - No.

1323
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,272
Mother, Natia here.

1324
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,192
Enchanted, I'm Lia.

1325
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,231
You can call me Aunt Lia.

1326
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,592
And here Otar. - Hi, delighted.

1327
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,554
Hello. - Hello. - Here Iva.

1328
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,678
Prepare dinner for tonight.

1329
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,035
I brought all kinds of treats.

1330
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,553
But you have to go shopping.

1331
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,675
I am helping you.

1332
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,432
No thank you, go watch TV.

1333
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,754
Assistance is not required.

1334
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,353
Lia takes care of everything.

1335
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,714
Mother what should I buy?

1336
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,755
Bread, tea, peas.

1337
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,277
Sandro brings glasses for that.

1338
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,869
Where did you get that?

1339
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,110
Your uncle gave them to me.

1340
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,509
Would you like to watch

1341
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,999
football or I change the channel?

1342
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,434
Let only.

1343
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,040
Do you like football? - Yes.

1344
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,872
This is part of the German championship,

1345
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,917
but I do not recognize the teams.

1346
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,638
Hamburg and Dortmund.

1347
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,313
Well.

1348
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,034
You love German football?

1349
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,918
No, Italian.

1350
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,950
Girls love Italian football.

1351
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,917
Beautiful kids in shorts,

1352
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,752
running after a ball.

1353
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,952
It's not that.

1354
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,029
I just love their style.

1355
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,552
I like the importance given

1356
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,755
defense.

1357
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,229
And what do you like it?

1358
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,836
They always play defense.

1359
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,470
Their goals are always in danger.

1360
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,629
It is tense,

1361
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,119
when you see them play.

1362
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,712
I love this tension.

1363
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,190
But it's not just the tension.

1364
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,551
They also score goals, is not it?

1365
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:57,789
Oh yes, they do.

1366
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,590
Past! Make a pass! He did what there?

1367
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,835
That is why I

1368
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,831
do not like the German football.

1369
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:10,031
What could he do? - He should have

1370
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,270
play the ball from the right.

1371
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,035
The right or left? - The right.

1372
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,758
You, you understand what football.

1373
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,711
Come over here.

1374
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,751
Look at him.

1375
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,516
This boy has problems.

1376
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,913
Then go talk to him.

1377
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,957
what should I tell him?

1378
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,035
Does it really

1379
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,111
defrauded a family in mourning?

1380
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,951
He has not cheated.

1381
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,835
The son of the family

1382
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,479
lost cards.

1383
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,429
Without your man

1384
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,477
the type is now in penury.

1385
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,355
There would be problems in prison.

1386
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,356
He behaved bravely.

1387
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,592
He was attacked by 20 men,

1388
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,398
but he was not afraid and remained calm.

1389
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,318
You're a good man.

1390
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,950
And you will find a good woman.

1391
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,797
Bring her here too.

1392
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,357
For hairdressing.

1393
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,873
I cap both men

1394
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,519
than women.

1395
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,239
