00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,233
R. Kotanjyan as Levon
K. Khandanyan as Anoush


15
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,674
Arthur Sahakyan as Samvel


16
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,229
As you can guess,


17
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,197
if a movie is called "The Men"


18
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,874
then, the main character, 
naturally, would be a woman. 


19
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,837
However, let's not rush the story.


20
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,911
The movie is called "The Men",
and one cannot ignore that.


21
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,754
There are many men in Armenia,
and today that is not a secret anymore.


22
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,194
We will tell you about only four of them.


23
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,714
So, the first one is Vazgen.


24
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:33,428
Vazgen never confines himself 
to merely his own interests.


25
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:37,877
Whatever dispute takes place in the city,
his is the last word,


26
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,031
because the wisdom and
the integrity of that man


27
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,512
is directly proportional to the respect
Vazgen has earned among all the strata


28
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,352
of the urban population.


29
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,949
"Let me think" Vazgen says.


30
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,998
You have to agree that is 
surprisingly simple and wise.


31
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:59,071
And everybody around 
suddenly feels at ease.


32
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,279
Sako.
He is not a painter.


33
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,072
But he understands life.


34
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,910
Clearly, the longing 
for beauty inhabited




35
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,547
the most hidden corners of his 
sophisticated soul for too long




36
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,793
and only now bursted out
with some violent force.


37
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,951
And if now sometimes Sako
finds himself walking on streets


38
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,395
not very well-lit


39
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,119
trust me, it is only so he can


40
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,267
once again realize how far
he is from all of that.


41
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,829
True, some, who encounters him,
are startled for a second.




42
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,877
But it's only for a second.


43
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,155
The entire city knows that
Sako has a will of steel.


44
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,354
Suren.


45
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,993
Suren jan.


46
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,437
With all due sympathy 
to that man






47
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:47,077
one hardly can call him wise,
in fact, that would be impossible.


48
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
City folk might say that
he has air in his head,


49
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,958
and to a certain degree
that is a fair assessment.


50
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,553
This is a cake.


51
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,908
Not just a cake.


52
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,675
This cake is made in a factory,
which for many years




53
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,434
was run by Suren's 
younger brother Romeo.




54
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,632
This is Romeo's wife Medea.


55
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,075
And this is their son Hamlet.


56
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,988
This is Souren's mom.


57
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:25,277
At first glance, everything
in her life seems ideal.


58
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,629
But that is not so.


59
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,035
The fact that Suren is still a bachelor


60
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,076
taints the taste of the cake
and the sound of the music.


61
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,989
This is Souren's grandfather Hamazasp.


62
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:41,310
They say, he was the first
to drive a car in our city.


63
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,870
They say, Souren's father Vardan
made it to Berlin with his lorry,




64
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,998
and on one of the front-line roads,
he picked up Marshal Baghramyan.




65
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,308
They say.


66
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,749
They say.


67
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,467
They say.


68
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,349
Grandma Vartanush knows very well
why Souren has air in his head.


69
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,590
In fact, he is the only one
who doesn't know.


70
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,910
The youngest of the four men,
who came to our city,


71
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,833
is a distance learning student 
at the Agricultural Institute.


72
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,034
Aram.


73
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,789
Aram works in 
the 3rd taxi parking lot,




74
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,518
Where he has found connection,


75
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,437
true friendship,
and even protection


76
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,476
of the other three men.


77
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,914
Pay attention to that glance.


78
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,478
It is not innate,


79
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,268
it has been acquired 
more or less recently.




80
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,277
The first overwhelming emotion


81
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,112
that befell Aram,


82
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,793
has made his glance that way.


83
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,872
Karine, the daughter of a well-respected
scientist Smbad Kalashyan,


84
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,554
did not have the faintest idea.


85
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,395
Of all the exemplary
qualities of a real man,




86
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,110
Aram possesses the most noble, 
he is not talkative.




87
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,955
There existed too many incredible 
situations in his imagination,




88
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,078
where he might have become
acquainted with Karine.


89
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,471
But none of them were 
meant to arise.


90
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,719
This ancient dance
is called kochari.


91
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,316
It's main characteristic is that
only men dance it.




92
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,471
Women are occupied with housework.


93
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,236
So, men dance it
hands locked tightly,




94
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,754
huddled shoulder to shoulder.


95
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:36,029
Kochari will denote 
a new chapter in our story.




96
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,714
He is called by the common 
Armenian name Levon.


97
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,309
These are Levon's watches.


98
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:21,915
Not only they tell time, date, 
the day of the week, month, and year,


99
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,196
but also the average 
temperature on the Solaris,


100
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:29,797
and most importantly, the direction
and the speed of drifting icebergs.




101
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,360
Levon's job is difficult 
and responsible.


102
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,989
The difficulty lies in that 
he must always pretend


103
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,074
to derive immense pleasure from
the nauseating curiosity of tourists.


104
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,558
The responsibility of his job lies in that


105
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,710
he has no right to forget,
not even for a minute,


106
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,075
that in front of him is a distant West,


107
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,914
behind him native Armenia.


108
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,951
What else?


109
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,389
Oh yes, to our story Levon 


110
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,709
has almost no connection,


111
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,599
which gives us the right to resolutely
return to our protagonists,




112
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,718
who today work for Intourist.


113
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,835
В маршруте этой группы улица,
по которой мы едем, не значилась.
The road we drive now
is not on the group's route.




114
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,434
It's Vazgen's personal initiative.


115
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,198
He wise thoughts churned over


116
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,955
the unsolved problem
of his young colleague.




117
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,078
Yes, this is the house
Karine lives in. 




118
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,633
Here is some news.


119
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,750
Turns out, they know each other.


120
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,114
Sergeant Sahakyan, in fact,
as all traffic police in the city,




121
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,908
is not only an excellent professional,
but well educated person.




122
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:55,913
Have you heard?


123
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,514
We are still going to have to deal
with Karine's little brother.




124
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,869
The dentist Ghazaryan himself


125
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,514
and his wife don't have the faintest idea


126
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,638
about the wonderful 
surprises awaiting them. 


127
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,276
It seems,


128
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:48,511
that Vazgen's bright mind came up 
with something of a salvation. 




129
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:49,715
I feel like


130
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,316
he is about to pronounce
his famous "let me think,"


131
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,869
which means that everything
has been thought of already.


132
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,835
And there it is. 




133
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,637
Turns out there is
a simple solution.




134
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,238
You need to do what Vazgen's 
father did in his own time, propose.




135
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,390
Aram has no father.
But he has a mother.


136
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,912
She will go to Kalashyan.


137
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,311
It's like this, Smbat Arakelovich,
Here is my Aram, here is your Karine,


138
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,276
let's become in-laws.


139
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,876
With that in mind they went to
Ashtarak, the hometown of Aram.


140
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:54,393
This is Anoush, Aram's neighbor.


141
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,869
How quickly they grow,
the neighborhood girls.


142
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,833
Aram's mother.


143
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,154
This is grandma Nenek.
She is baking lavash.


144
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,155
Anoush's brother is called James.


145
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,993
As you can see, name trends
found their way to this place too.


146
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,628
Have you ever had a chance
to sit at a Caucasian table?


147
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,227
Not yet?


148
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:14,676
It means you are yet 
to experience the awe




149
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,833
of your own merits, the ones
you did not even suspect you had.. 


150
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,836
A true toastmaster will make sure
to point out the most hidden 


151
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,553
and most beautiful parts
of your soul.


152
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,029
Despite having just met you
for the first time.




153
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,029
And although glasses are full 
with excellent grape wine,




154
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,154
a lot more will be spoken
than drunk at the table.


155
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,434
Maybe that is why there are 
no detox centers in Armenia.


156
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,999
Who knows.


157
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,716
Сейчас, мне кажется, Вазген
найдет самую подходящую минуту,
I feel like now Vazgen 
will find the right moment,


158
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,437
ЧТОбЫ ИЗЛОЖИТЬ маме Арама
to present to Aram's mother


159
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,751
ВСЮ значительность
надвигающихся СОбЫТИЙ.
the entire importance 
of the upcoming events.


160
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,712
Ануш, сядь рядом с Арамом.
Anoush, take a sit next to Aram.


161
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,349
Стойте, стойте,
что же это получается?
Wait, what's happening?


162
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,748
Оказывается, У мамы
на ЭТОТ счет СВОИ ВИДЫ.
Turns out the mother has 
her own ideas on that matter.


163
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,397
Согласитесь, такого обстоятельства
Вазген предвидеть не МОГ.
You have to agree, Vazgen 
couldn't have predicted that.


164
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,314
Ай-ай-ай!
Tut-tut! 




165
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,956
Однако отказаться ОТ идеи
сватовства Вазген не МОГ,
However, Vazgen couldn't abandon 
the idea of matchmaking,




166
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:13,794
так КаК Арам НИ О КОМ, кроме
Карине, И слушать не хотел.
since Aram didn't want to even hear
about anybody other than Karine.


167
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,071
Безвыходных ситуаций
для Вазгена не существует.
There are no impossible 
situations for Vazgen.


168
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,752
Сватать будет дядя.
The uncle will ask for marriage.


169
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,230
дядей назначен Сурен.
Souren is appointed as the uncle.


170
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,799
Калашьян.
Kalashyan.


171
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,236
— Здравствуйте.
— Здравствуйте.
Hello.
Hello.


172
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,038
Вы Калашьян?
Are you Kalashyan?


173
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,996
— да, но…
— Это вам.
Yes, but…
This is for you.


174
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,348
Не понимаю.
I don't understand.


175
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,959
Здесь фотодокументы.
Here are the photo documents.


176
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:08,872
Мне НеОбХОДИМО ГОВОРИТЬ
С вами тет-а-тет.
I need to speak to you
tête-à-tête. 


177
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,313
Прошу, пожалуйста.
Come in, please.


178
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,515
Благодарю.
Thank you.


179
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,952
Ничего не понимаю.
I don't understand anything.


180
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,632
— Товарищ...
— Меня зовут Сурен.
Comrade…
My name is Souren.


181
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,792
Сурен умеет произвести
впечатление даже на профессора,
Souren can make a good impression
even on a professor,


182
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,238
ХОТЯ ИЗ'ЬЯСНЯТЬСЯ ПО-РУССКИ ему
сложнее, чем на РОДНОМ языке.
although for him Russian is much harder 
than his native language.


183
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,032
Очень приятно.
Pleased to meet you.


184
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,158
О, как у вас здесь
очень даже хорошо!
Oh, what a nice place
you got here!




185
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,398
— Садитесь.
— Спасибо, и вы садитесь.
Take a sit.
Thank you, you too, please.


186
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:41,073
да, я сказал,
что здесь фотодокументы.
Oh yes, I told you, 
here are the photo documents.


187
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:44,675
Вот смотрите, за Вазгеном
стоит мой племянник Арам.
Look, here behind Vazgen
stands my nephew Aram.


188
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,352
Понимаю, Арам.
I understand, that's Aram.


189
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,437
А здесь написано:
"На память Карине от Арама".
And here it says,
"For Karine from Aram."




190
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,635
Понимаю, от Арама.
I understand, it's from Aram.




191
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,392
Арам никого так не любит,
как вашу дочь.
Aram loves your daughter
like nobody else.


192
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,789
Человек он скромный,
среднего роста.
He is a humble man
of an average height.


193
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,679
Среднего?
Любопытно.
Average?
How curious.




194
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,068
УЧ ИТСЯ В И нституте.
He studies at the institute.


195
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:05,673
— А кто родители?
— Из деревни.
Who are the parents?
Villagers.


196
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,634
думаю, что…
I think that...


197
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,956
ВЫ не знаете СЭГОДНЯШНеЙ деревни.
You don't know today's village.


198
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,907
В конце концов, какая разница,
откуда родом его родители?
After all, what difference does it make
where his parents are from?


199
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,677
Учтите, Арам способен на всё!
Раз, два, три, четыре, пять и — кх!
Consider, Aram is desparate!
One, two, three, four, five and bang!


200
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:23,787
Нет человека.
Вас будет мучить совесть всю жизнь.
He is gone.
The guilt will torment you for a life.


201
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:31,475
Я отсюда никуда не уйду,
пока вы не дадите свое согласие.
I won't leave anywhere until 
you give your blessing.




202
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,878
Никуда.
Nowhere.


203
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,593
да, он мой племянник.
Но он рос без отца.
True, he is my nephew.
But he grew up without a father.


204
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,672
Я ему был и отцом,
и братом, и дядей, И дРУГОм.
I was a father, a brother, an uncle 
and a friend to him.


205
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:52,517
Ну, что ж, рад был
с вами познакомиться.
Well, it was a pleasure to meet you.




206
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:53,429
Я тоже.
Likewise.


207
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,795
Извините, я переоденусь.
Располагайтесь.
Excuse me while I change. 
Make yourself comfortable.




208
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,551
Очень МИЛЫЙ человек.
Such a nice man.


209
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,437
Извините, дорогой Сурен,
я немного задержался.
I apologize, dear Souren,
it took me a while.




210
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,830
Садитесь, садитесь.
Here, take a sit.


211
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,390
Столько близнецов
под одной крышей.
So many twins
under one roof.


212
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,432
да, профессура —
это всё же профессура.
Professoriate is professoriate.
professorship?


213
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,796
— Ваше здоровье.
— Спасибо.
Your health.
Thank you.


214
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:21,907
— Угощайтесь.
— Угощаюсь.
Help yourself.
I am helping myself.


215
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,399
— Пожалуйста.
— Спасибо.
Please.
Thank you.


216
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,436
Скоро Карине придет.
Karine will be here soon.


217
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,872
Это хорошо.
That's good.


218
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,716
Очень хорошо.
Very good.


219
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,511
Моя старшая дочь дездемона.
My older daughter Desdemona. 


220
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,396
Удивление Сурена
настолько искренне,
Souren's surprise is so sincere,


221
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,074
что он незаметно для себя
перешел на армянский.
that he 




222
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,509
Эта Карине тоже хороша.
This Karine is good too.


223
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,274
И на его, Сурена, вкус,
может, даже лучше той.
And to Souren's taste, maybe 
even better than the other.


224
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,117
Ох, если бы не упрямство
этого Арама!
Oh, if only Aram was not so stubborn.


225
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,037
Об отступлении
не могло быть и речи.




226
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,512
Ай-ай-ай!


227
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,954
Вазген уже был близок к тому,
чтобы отказаться от этого дела.
Vazgen was so close 
to abandon the case.


228
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:03,118
Но во взгляде Арама
было столько мольбы и надежды!
But there was so much plea 
and hope in Aram's glance.


229
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,118
И Арам понял, что Вазгена
осенила новая идея.
And Aram understood that
Vazgen had a new idea.


230
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,873
Идея проста, не правда ли?
Is it a simple idea, is it not?


231
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,554
Итак, приступим к ее реализации.
So , let's get to the implementation. 


232
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,231
ВСё складывается
КаК нельзя лучше.
Things are going
just as planned.


233
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,598
Снимай табличку, Арам, быстро.
Get rid of the … Aram, quick.


234
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,836
Ну, отвечай: "да, я свободен".
Come on, answer her, "Yes, I am free."


235
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:32,909
Арам!
Aram!


236
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:36,954
Что же ты молчишь, Арам?
Why are you silent, Aram?


237
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,355
Арам!
Aram!


238
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,630
Нет, ЭТО НеПОСТИЖИМО.
This is unbelievable. 


239
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:51,470
Ай-ай-ай!


240
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,637
Было бы заблуждением считать,
It would be a mistake to assume


241
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:52,029
будто наши мужчины
никогда не расставались.
that our men never parted.


242
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,917
Во-первых, их разлучали пассажиры,
First of all, they parted their ways
because of passangers,


243
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,513
которые указывали
самые разные маршруты.
who specified
very different routes. 


244
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:59,637
Потом, у каждого были
и свои заботы. Всё это так.
Then, everybody had their own life.
All that is true. 


245
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:03,189
Но друзья никогда не упускали
случая быть вместе.
But the friends never missed 
a chance to be together.


246
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,271
А СТОИЛО ИМ ТОЛЬКО СОбРаТЬСЯ,
And everytime they gathered


247
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:10,758
КаК ВНОВЬ возникала неотложная
задача — КаК ПОМОЧЬ Араму.
the pressing issue on how to help 
Aram would arise. 




248
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:39,671
действительно, придумано здорово.
Indeed, a great idea.


249
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,077
Вариант беспроигрышный.


250
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:49,758
Но даже ради друга Сако
не соглашался на роль хулигана.
But even for the friend's sake Sako 
couldn't agree to the hooligan's role.


251
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,991
Это, в общем, понятно.
All in all, it is understandable. 


252
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,948
Сурен готов
на что угодно, однако…
Souren is ready for anything, though...


253
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:03,835
Это тоже, в общем, понятно.
That too is understandable. 


254
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:06,468
Да…
Yes.. 


255
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,517
Свистеть, к сожалению,
Вазген не умел.
Unfortunately, Vazgen did not
know how to whistle.


256
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,074
Карине, К сожалению, не испугалась.
Karine, unfortunately, did not get scared.


257
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,318
Малыш не заплакал.
The kid did not cry.


258
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:21,431
Бежать ей трудно.
It is hard for her to run.


259
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:26,358
Вазгену тоже, у него
неважная кардиограмма.
It is hard for Vazgen too,
his cardiogram is poor.




260
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:55,108
Повышенная душевная
возбудимость влюбленного
Increased mental sensitivity




261
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,871
тоже не была учтена Вазгеном.
wasn't considered by Vazgen either.


262
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:06,712
"Окмяцек" — это
по-армянски "помогите".
"Ognetsek" is "help" in Armenian.


263
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,991
Ай-ай-ай!


264
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,795
"Ес кес сирумем" —
по-армянски "я люблю тебя".
"Yes kez sirum em" is 
"I love you" in Armenian.


265
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:32,712
НИ О каком сватовстве, знакомстве,


266
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,749
ни о какой взаимности
Арам уже и не мечтал.


Aram could not dream anymore.


267
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:43,155
СКРаСИТЬ его существование могла
ЛИШЬ ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ видеть Карине.
Only the possibility of seeing Karine
could brighten up his existence.


268
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,751
Видеть?
Неужели и это невозможно?
Seeing her? 
Is that not possible either? 


269
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:27,677
Подумать надо.
Let me think.


270
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,238
дальнейшая картина
представлялась Вазгену
The picture Vazgen 
saw in his mind


271
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:36,196
совершенно ЯСНОЙ.
was absolutely clear.


272
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,357
Карине непременно заметит
ЭТОТ печальный ВЗГЛЯД.
Karine will definitely notice
this sad glance.




273
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:51,668
Заметит.
She will.


274
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,754
А УЖ когда заметит,
обязательно оценит.
And when she notices it,
she will definitely appreciate it.


275
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:06,355
Но как поселить Арама
в квартире зубного врача?
But how to… Aram
in the dentist's apartment?




276
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:10,114
для Вазгена это, конечно,
не представляло особого труда.
For Vazgen,of course, 
that was not too difficult.


277
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,709
Расчет Вазгена
был просто и безошибочен.
Vazgen's calculation was plain
and unmistakable. 


278
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,152
Какой армянин не окажет
гостеприимства тому,
No Armenian will fail to offer 
hospitality to anybody,




279
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:57,514
КТО назвался РОДСТВеН Н И КОМ?
who called oneself a relative.


280
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:48,597
Скоро придет жена.
The wife will come home soon.


281
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,593
БЫТЬ может, ЭТО ее РОДСТВеННИКИ?
Maybe they are her relatives?


282
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,239
Пришла жена.
The wife came.


283
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,470
Она честно пыталась
узнать ЭТИХ РОДСТВеННИКОВ.
She tried hard to
recognize these relatives.






284
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,869
Нет.
No.


285
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:20,358
Не знает.
She doesn't know them.


286
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,713
Не помнит.
Нет.
She doesn't remember. 
No.


287
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:33,677
РаЗГОВОР не очень клеился,
а молчание СТаНОВИЛОСЬ ТЯГОСТНЫМ.


288
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,357
Всего хорошего,
молодой человек.
All the best, young man.


289
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,714
Спасибо за всё, дядя,
за всё спасибо.
Thanks for everything, uncle.
Thank you.




290
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,111
Не грусти, брат,
у дяди тебе будет хорошо.
Do not be sad, brother.
The uncle will take good care of you.






291
00:56:07,479 --> 00:56:08,992
до свидания, тетя.
Farewell, aunty.


292
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:23,029
Тронут, очень тронут.
I am touched, very touched.


293
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:26,271
Я всё расскажу маме.
I will tell mom everything.


294
00:56:55,399 --> 00:56:59,187
до поздней ночи супруги
листали семейные альбомы,
Till late at night, the couple
Looked through the family albums,


295
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,156
пытаясь ОТЬ|СКаТЬ ЭТО звено
trying to find the missing link


296
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,392
в бесконечной цепи
фамильного родства.
in the endless chain of family members.




297
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,799
Безуспешно.
To no avail.




298
00:57:49,959 --> 00:57:53,747
Неужели нельзя сушить белье
где-нибудь в другом месте?
Why can't they dry the laundry
somewhere else?


299
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,879
Как хорошо,
что я встретил тебя, Сурен.
It's wonderful I met you here, Souren.


300
00:58:46,279 --> 00:58:48,793
Поздравь меня, друг, я женюсь.
Congratulate me, my friend,
I am getting married.




301
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,237
Только не спрашивай,
кто она, откуда, не спрашивай.
Don't ask me who she is,
where she is from, don't.


302
00:58:52,479 --> 00:58:55,118
Это не девушка, это легенда!
She is not a girl, she is a legend!


303
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:29,916
Вазген!
дорогои мои Вазген, иди к нам.
Vazgen! My dear Vazgen, come join us.


304
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,547
Не спрашивай, кто она.
Не спрашивай.
Don't ask who she is. Just don't.


305
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,395
душа поет.
давайте петь вместе.
My soul sings, let's sing together.


306
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,790
Только тихо, не надо будить город.
Sing quietly, no need to wake up the city.


307
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,389
Сако-джан!
Поздравь меня, я женюсь.
Sako jan! Congratulate me, 
I am getting married.




308
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,357
ТОЛЬКО не спрашивай, КТО она.
Don't ask who she is. 


309
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,674
А теперь ПРИГОТОВЬТеСЬ К самому
печальному месту В нашем рассказе.
Now embrace yourself for 
the saddest part in our story.


310
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:15,597
Вы помните Левона?
Ну, того, гида?
Do you remember Levon? 


311
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:19,872
Левона, который к нашей истории
почти никакого отношения не имеет?
That guide who had almost 
no connection to our story?


312
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,312
Наутро, конечно, выпал снег.
Of course, the next morning, 
it snowed.


313
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,916
Такого раннего снега
СТаРОЖИЛЫ не ПОМНЯТ.
The old-timers couldn't remember
snow that fell so early.

01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,998
Синоптики, как водится,
объясняли это редкое явление
Forecasters, as usual,
explained this rare phenomenon




315
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,276
ЦИКЛОНаМИ И антициклонами,
with cyclones and anticyclones,


316
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,679
СТОЛКНОВеНИЯМИ ХОЛОДНЫХ И теплых
масс где-то над морем Лаптевых.
the collision of cold and warm air masses 
somewhere over the Laptev Sea.




317
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:15,468
НО МЫ-ТО С вами знаем,
отчего снег выпал именно СЭГОДНЯ.
But you and I know why
it snowed today.


318
01:04:12,399 --> 01:04:14,310
Арам, ну как?
Aram, how are you?


319
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,918
Всё хорошо, Арам?
Are you okay, Aram?




320
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,553
Сегодня ОН не МОГ
ИМ сказать правды.
Today he could not
tell them the truth.


321
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:30,274
СТОЛЬКО сделали ОНИ ДЛЯ него.
They have done 
so much for him.


322
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:45,238
Конец
The end
